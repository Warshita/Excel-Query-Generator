# Excel Query Assistant

**Excel Query Assistant** is a web application built using **Streamlit** and powered by **Gemini-Pro LLM**. The app allows users to upload Excel files, which are seamlessly converted into a **SQLite** database. It then generates **SQL queries** to retrieve relevant information, providing an easy way to extract insights from complex Excel spreadsheets.

## Features

- **Excel File Upload**: Users can upload `.xlsx` files for data extraction.
- **Automatic Conversion**: Excel data is automatically converted into a **SQLite** database for efficient querying.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Automatically generates **SQL queries** based on user input, making it easy to retrieve specific information.
- **Streamlit UI**: Simple, intuitive interface for easy interaction with the app.

## How It Works

1. Upload your Excel file (.xlsx) through the app's interface.
2. The application will convert the Excel data into a SQLite database.
3. The Gemini-Pro LLM will automatically generate SQL queries to retrieve data based on the user's input.
4. View the query results directly within the app.

## Usage

- Upload Excel sheets with structured data.
- The app will automatically parse the data and generate SQL queries.
